## ⚡ Common Issues

### "Config validation failed"
➜ Create `.env` file with your API keys

### "Telegram connection failed"
➜ Start a chat with your bot first (send any message)

### "Module not found"
➜ Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### "No earnings found"
➜ Normal! Not every day has earnings. Bot waits for next opportunity.
